# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/). Written in TypeScript and run with Deno.

## To run locally

Make sure you have Deno:

```
brew install deno
```

Change into the directory corresponding to a day and run the `index.ts` script:

```
cd 01
deno run [--allow-read] index.ts
```
